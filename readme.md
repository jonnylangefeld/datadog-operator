# Datadog Operator

The [official Datadog Operator](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-operator)

> aims to provide a new way of deploying the Datadog Agent

but it doesn't allow to configure and manage resources like dashboards or monitors. That's where this
operator comes in.

### Run

`make run` will run the controller against the current cluster in the kube context. If this is your first time executing
the controller, make sure to run `make install` before.
The controller relies on the datadog api key and the datadog application key. You can either set the environment
variables `DATADOG_API_KEY` and `DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY`, or create a file like the following:

```json
{
  "api_key": "<your-api-key>",
  "application_key": "<your-application-key>"
}
```

The default location for this file is `.secrets.json`, but can be overwritten with the controller flag `--secrets-path`.

### Deploy

Run `make deploy` to deploy the controller on the current cluster in the kube context.
